## Dev Thoughts
As this is my last official class in my web development program, I figured it would be good to give a reflection on my thoughts of how far I've come, what I would've done differently if I could go back, and what I've changed about the things I do.

        <h3>Looking Back</h3>
        <p>Looking back on the stuff I made, it's kinda crazy to see how far I've come from starting just two years ago. It doesn't feel like it's been that long, but it also does in a weird way. From making unstyled pages with little to no extra styling, to making dynamic pages that load content from external files, with complex stylesheets that are simply collections of even more files. It's wild to look back and see what I was doing or how I was styling my pages compared to now.</p>

    <li class="card">
        <h3>What I Could Change</h3>
        <p>Taking time to reflect, I wish I had spent more time on my projects instead of doing the basics and passing the assignment. I think it's been a struggle with motivation issues, anxiety, and some other mental health struggles that have been making it hard to feel truly passionate about things. While I don't blame myself for having those issues, I think reaching out sooner or trying to get myself more involved like joining relevant clubs would've helped out quite a bit.</p>

        <h3>What I'm Doing Different</h3>
        <p>Now, I feel a wave of motivation to complete not only this project, but to go back and work on other stuff for my own site, something I hadn't really touched since I made it back in late 2024. I think trying to challenge myself to unique web projects and even integrate some RSS feeds on my phone or computer can also keep me somewhat in the mindset of web development. At the end of the day, I'm still in the program, I made it to the end of it, and I enjoyed it, so there's clearly something I feel towards what I'm doing that's continuing to push me in the direction I'm going.</p>

## Charting the Future
This section is dedicated to what my plans are for the future, including my professional and personal goals.

        <h3>Q2 & Q3 2025</h3>
        <p>As of the time of writing this, it is currently early May, and there is quite a bit of stuff going on within these few months. I'm finishing up my web development program with a study abroad trip to Scotland this June. I'm extremely excited for the opportunity, and the college we are working with, Robert Gordon University, is a college I'm interested in going through with their 2+1 program, where I can get a bachelor's degree by only going for one year.</p>
        <p>Besides that, I'm currently trying to finish up some final projects, as well as retroactively update my school site to be eventually be ready to be dropped into my own personal site. That does cause for longer days and a lot more time in my code editor (lol), but I've been riding a wave of motivation and I've been able to take a few hours each day and continue picking away at it.</p>
        <p>With that being said, I'm hoping to have everything ready before my study abroad trip, so afterwards, I can simply include my personal website on my resume as a mass portfolio for any jobs I apply to. Currently, the best option is looking like applying for a remote job, and I have a few saved already, but they are looking for portfolios, and that is what I'm currently trying to work on in the background with school going on.</p>

        <h3>Q4 2025 - Q2 2026</h3>
        <p>After this little bit of a busy time, I'll be starting with classes again, even after I graduate with my web development degree. This is due to me also pursuing an associate's in software development. In addition to web development, a passion of mine I want to pursue would be video game designing / development. Even if it isn't something I would want to fully go for if I get into it, having the skills and experience would definitely be useful. My terms will be looking a little less heavy than they have been, which is good considering I will hopefully have a job of some sort at that time.</p>
        <p>After I finish those classes and eventually graduate with my degree in software development, I'm seriously considering applying to Robert Gordon University for one of their programming / web bachelor programs. The experience abroad would be incredible, as well as the kind of stuff I'd learn in such a program.</p>

        <h3>Late 2026 - Mid 2027</h3>
        <p>At this point, it's purely speculation. Ideally, I'd want to be in Scotland studying abroad at RGU. Depending on my time there, I may even consider moving there entirely if that's something I want to pursue, but that's quite a large decision to make.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="card">
        <h3>Late 2027 & Beyond</h3>
        <p>This section is kind of dedicated to things I want to do when I'm done with school for the near/distant future. I'd like to travel to Japan with some of my friends for a few weeks, living in the countryside while also getting to explore cities like Kyoto & Shibuya. Ironically, as a web developer / programmer, I love nature and the outdoors. I love going on hikes, and I truly think exploring some of the niche spots in rural Japan would be breathtaking. If Scotland doesn't seem appealing, I could always consider moving to Japan as well.</p>
        <p>Not to mention, I have a good friend in Belgium I would like to visit. Ideally, it would be before this timeframe, but if I keep as busy as I have been for the past two years, it wouldn't be until about now when I could get the opportunity to do so. She had mentioned something about an active zoo where the animal pens are naturally formed from overgrown castle ruins... and that sounds so amazing. Overall, I want to go out and explore the world while I'm not as tied down with obligations as I could be. I've heard that it only gets harder to do those cool things the older you get.</p>

## Final Thoughts
Overall, that's really my thoughts summed up. I'm not planning too much into the future to focus on the present, but it gives me something to look forward to for sure. I know this page has been a lot of reading, but I'm treating it as sort of a diary entry, something that it a few years, I can look back on and see how far I've come. By the time this is live on the internet, on my site specifically (aallenprojects.me), this will have been the last web project I will have worked on for my classes, and I'm going to miss it.

Take care, and thank you for reading, Alex A.
