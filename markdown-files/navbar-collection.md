## Navigation Bar Collection
Throughout several of my classes, I have utilized a variety of navigation bars to offer unique ways of navigating to other pages on those sites. Below are some of the navigation bars in their full style on their respective pages, as well as a review of the navigation bar as a whole.

<nav class="wfed2-navbar-nav">
    <ul class="wfed2-navbar-ul">
        <li class="wfed2-navbar-li">
            <a href="index.html">Home</a>
        </li>
        <li class="wfed2-navbar-li">
            <a href="index.html">Envy</a>
        </li>
        <li class="wfed2-navbar-li">
            <a href="index.html">Veerle</a>
        </li>
        <li class="wfed2-navbar-li">
            <a href="index.html">Github</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
</nav>
